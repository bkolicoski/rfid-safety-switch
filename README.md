# RFID safety switch
An Arduino based RFID safety switch for my workshop that cuts entire AC power to the outlets. Watch the build video below:

# Background
Since my kids enter my workshop even when I'm not there, I wanted to have a way to kill power to the outlets so that even if there is a power tool plugged in, they can't switch it on and possibly injure themselves.
